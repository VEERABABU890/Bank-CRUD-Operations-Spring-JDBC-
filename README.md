Project Title: Bank CRUD Operations (Spring JDBC)
Project Description:
This project is a Bank Management System that performs basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Spring JDBC. The system allows users to manage customer bank accounts, including creating new accounts, retrieving account information, updating account details, and deleting accounts.
The project demonstrates the integration of Spring Framework with JDBC for database interactions, focusing on using SQL statements to manage records in a relational database.

Key Features:
Create: Allows users to create new bank accounts with details like account number, account holder's name, balance, and account type.
Read: Users can view account details by searching using the account number or other attributes.
Update: Allows users to update account details such as balance or account holder information.
Delete: Allows users to delete an account from the system.
JDBC Integration: Utilizes Spring JDBC for database connectivity and interaction, allowing smooth execution of SQL queries and transaction management.
Spring Framework: Leverages core features of Spring (e.g., Dependency Injection) to simplify the application and ensure loose coupling between components.

Technologies Used:
Spring JDBC: For interacting with the relational database.
Spring Framework: For managing beans, dependency injection, and configuration.
MySQL (or any other relational database): For storing bank account records.
Java: For the backend logic and implementing CRUD operations.
Maven/Gradle: For dependency management.
JDBC Template: For simplifying database operations and queries.

How to Run:
Clone or download the repository.
Make sure you have Java and Maven or Gradle installed on your system.
Set up a MySQL (or any relational) database on your local machine or configure an existing database in the application.properties file (located in src/main/resources).

Example for MySQL:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bankdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
Build the project using Maven or Gradle:

Run the project using your IDE or from the command line:
Run the BankApplication class (the main Spring Boot application class).
Once the application is running, you can access the CRUD operations via the console or integrate a simple REST API for handling requests.

User Instructions:
Create Account: Input details like account number, holder name, balance, and account type to create a new bank account.
View Account: Use the account number to retrieve account details.
Update Account: Modify the balance or account holder information for a specific account.
Delete Account: Delete an account by specifying the account number.

Example:
java
Copy code
// Example code for creating a new account:
JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
String sql = "INSERT INTO accounts (account_number, holder_name, balance, account_type) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
jdbcTemplate.update(sql, newAccount.getAccountNumber(), newAccount.getHolderName(), newAccount.getBalance(), newAccount.getAccountType());
